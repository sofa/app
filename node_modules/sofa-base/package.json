  "readme": "# How is this repository organized?\n\nCurrently we maintain both the upcoming SDK as well as an app implementation which is written on top of the SDK in this repository.\nAll SDK related files are located within the `sdk` directory and it's subdirectories.\n\nThe app is located within the `app` directory and it's subdirectories.\n\n#What do I need to get the app running?\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n1. You must have `compass` installed\n \n2. You must have `node.js` installed\n\n3. You must have the `grunt-cli` installed\n\nThen follow this process:\n\n1. Checkout the repository\n\n2. Navigate to `app` on the console\n\n3. Run `grunt`\n\n4. Open another console tab and navigate to `sdk``\n\n5. Run `grunt`\n\n6. Open the `app/dist/index.html` in your browser\n\n#What do I need to work on the SDK?\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n1. You must have `node.js` installed\n\n2. You must have the `grunt-cli` installed\n\n3. Navigate to `sdk` on the console\n\n4. Run `grunt`\n\n#Further tips\n\ngrunt will keep running in both terminal sessions. Keep it running, it does all the heavy\nlifting behind the scenes.\n\n#Contribute\n\nWe'd love you to contribute.
